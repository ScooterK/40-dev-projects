# 40 Days of Development 

40 projets of Development is a project in which I develop a new project every day to practice web development.


## Project 1 - Calculator App
```
I followed a youtube tutorial on this one just to get back into the swing of things. 
```

## Project 2 - Quiz App 
```
Making a quiz app here is the logic I'm working towards creating. 

Logic: 

class {
	question: 
	possible answer array
	correct position of answer in array 
}

on page load questions and randomized and the answer order is randomized. 

logic can dictate if need for radio buttons or checkboxes depending on how many correct answers

click event that checks the answer selected is correct

ability at end of questions to check and change answer of selected
